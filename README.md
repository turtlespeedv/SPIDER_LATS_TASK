# SPIDER_LATS_TASK
Hello i am vedansh from eee 2nd year, app dev domain

I have included all the parts of the tasks i was able to complete in this repo, i was not able to integrate all of them in one single place right, so i have included them individually.
FOLLOWING ARE THE INSTRUCTIONS TO OPEN THEM:-


**First of all, in the terminal cd to whatever app you want to test first, for example if you want to check the collaborative editing app, first enter cd COLLABORATIVE_DOCUMENT, then follow the steps given below.
**


FOR CHAT APP:-
You can copy the index.html file into your browser or just write npm start in the terminal which will give a link with port number 3000, open that, and it will work. 
Enter the workspace id, could be anything, open the link in another tab, and enter the same workspace id, and now you can chat with each other. (Check the console in the browser after creating the workspace id to make sure you are connected to the server.)
(Also click on the send button to send message, pressing enter doesnt work.)

FOR COLLABORATIVE EDITING APP:-
IMPORTANT- first enter **"npm install"** to install the node modules, do this first otherwise it wont work.
Enter **npm start** and a site will open, you can start writing in the space given in the middle, Open another tab with the link and you will see that writing in one tab will automatically illustrate that change in the other, this can be done with multiple users.
